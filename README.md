### [0x00-lockboxes](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/0x00-lockboxes "0x00-lockboxes")

This is an excercise in which there are `n` boxes, each labeled sequentially from `0` to `n - 1`. The label of each box corresponds to its index position in the list `boxes`. Each box contains keys which can unluck other boxes.

The goal of this task is to determine if every box in the list can be unlocked.

### [0x02-minimum_operations](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/0x02-minimum_operations "0x02-minimum_operations")

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

This file returns the minimum number of operations to achieve `n` letters in a text file. There are only 2 operations, `Copy All` and `Paste`.

This is an excercise in which there are `n` boxes, each labeled sequentially from `0` to `n - 1`. The label of each box corresponds to its index position in the list `boxes`. Each box contains keys which can unluck other boxes.

The goal of this task is to determine if every box in the list can be unlocked.
